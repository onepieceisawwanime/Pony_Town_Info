**A bit of info about me and how I play Pony Town**
Fandom info: I'm in many fandoms, so if you have a cos, I probably know who it is. Most of the fandoms I'm in are horror games (some normal games also) and anime.

Socialization info: I'm friendly to everyone. I accept C + H from people in the same fandom as me. If you're not in the same fandom as me, please inc with me before asking to sit with me. Most of the time, I'll be sitting with someone I know (Online or irl), but this doesn't mean you can't sit with me!

Please dont cover me up completely. You can block me a bit, but I'd still like people can see me. 
Blocking: I don't block people unless, for some reason, I need to. I also might hide you if I'm not able to see the person you're talking to, cause it's just kinda awkward to watch. (Sorry, nothing personal)

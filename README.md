**A bit of info about me and how I play Pony Town**

( All my ponies are linked here, unless the skin I made is new and I forgot, sry :(] )

Fandoms (That I have a COS for): OP, MHA, InuYasha, Omori, BATIM, Genshin, DW, HK, MD, FNAF, MLP, (That's it for no,w but I'll be making more! :>)

Socialization info: I'm friendly to everyone. I accept C + H from people in the same fandom as me. If you're not in the same fandom as me, please int with me before asking to sit with me. 
Please dont cover me up completely. You can cover me a bit, but I'd still like people can see me. 
Blocking: I don't block people unless, for some reason, I need to. I also might hide you if I'm not able to see the person you're talking to, cause it's just kinda awkward to watch. (Sorry, nothing personal)

For some reason, a lot of times when I look at a OP pony town GitHub, I see a thing that says you don't int w/ Lawlu shippers. I'm a Lawlu shipper. So if you don't like Lawlu shippers and don't want them near you, you dont have to int.
